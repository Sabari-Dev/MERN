      <dt>What is HTML?</dt>
      <dd>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
        web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
        within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
        and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
        basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

      <dt>What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</dt>
      <dd>
        In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a
        single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple spaces
        into a single space character and this helps a developer to indent lines
        of text without worrying about multiple spaces and maintain readability
        and understand ability of HTML codes.

      <dt>
        What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’
        attribute of HTML elements?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, whereas a value
        of id attribute of one element cannot be associated with another HTML
        element.

      <dt>Define multipart form data?</dt>
      <dd>
        Multipart form data is one of the values of the enctype attribute. It is
        used to send the file data to the server-side for processing. The other
        valid values of the enctype attribute are text/plain and
        application/xwww-form-urlencoded.
