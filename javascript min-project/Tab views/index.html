              An early prototype was made in mid-2014, followed by a more
              complete version in 2015.[2] The vehicle was released in India in
              early 2016, followed by a release in international markets such as
              Philippines, Australia and the United Kingdom later that year.
              Both domestic and export model now gets Electronic Fuel Injection
              and ABS as standard.Upon its introduction, the Himalayan was
              praised for its good suspension and off-road ability, while some
              criticism was directed to the relatively low power output of the
              engine.[4] The motorcycle also has longer intervals between
              servicing and oil changes
